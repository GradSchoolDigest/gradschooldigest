                <p style="text-align:justify;">
								Our blood is a bountiful source of information that cancer researchers
								and clinicians have been tapping into for over a century. For instance,
								many cancer <b>biomarkers</b> (quantifiable indicators of cancer presence)
								can be found in blood and are useful in making clinical decisions [1].
								It is important to note, though, that biomarkers aren’t only found
								in blood. For example, a CT scan or molecular profiling of a tissue
								biopsy may also act as cancer biomarkers [1,2].
							  </p>

								<p style="text-align:justify;">
								One of the first cancer biomarkers I learned about was the prostate-specific
								antigen (PSA), when unfortunately, my father was diagnosed
								with prostate cancer. PSA is a protein secreted by the prostate,
								and in healthy men only small amounts circulate the bloodstream.
								When the PSA level in blood rises, it may indicate prostate cancer [3].
								In my father’s case, testing for PSA allowed for early
								detection of his cancer and led to a successful treatment.
								However, PSA isn’t a perfect biomarker since it’s not specific
								to prostate cancer. For example, some men may have increased PSA
								levels due to an inflamed prostate or a urinary tract infection.
								Because of this, increased PSA levels aren’t enough to diagnose
								prostate cancer, so physicians must take a tissue biopsy of the
								prostate to investigate further [3].
								</p>

								<p style="text-align:justify;">
								Blood-derived cancer biomarkers have many uses beyond early disease
								detection – they can help with formulating a diagnosis, providing
								insight into clinical outcomes, or predicting a patient’s response
								to a particular treatment. Also, cancer biomarkers aren’t restricted
								to proteins (like PSA); other cellular, genomic, transcriptomic
								and metabolomic biomarkers may be found in blood as well [1,2].
								</p>

								<p style="text-align:justify;">
								For this article, I’m going to narrow in on an exciting and relatively
								new cancer biomarker: <b>circulating tumour DNA</b> (ctDNA). When cells die,
								they release fragments of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the body’s
								circulatory system; when these fragments originate from cancer cells,
								they are called ctDNA. These fragments encode key information about
								the specific cancer, making them more favourable biomarkers compared
								to indirect approaches, such as PSA or radiographic images.
								The genetic mutations in ctDNA directly reflect mutations found
								in the tumour, which means that ctDNA can provide similar molecular
								profiling as a tissue biopsy [2,4]. That’s why blood tests to detect
								ctDNA are called <b>liquid biopsies</b>.
								</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify;">
						  You may be thinking “If we can already get the same information from
							a tissue biopsy, what’s the point of doing liquid biopsies?”. However,
							liquid biopsies have some important benefits to keep in mind. The most
							obvious advantage is that liquid biopsies are easily obtained through
							non-invasive means [4]. For many cancer types, tissue biopsies can be
							difficult to obtain and a pain in the butt for patients (<i>quite
							literally for prostate cancer, sorry dad</i>). These invasive procedures
							also carry additional risks, such as postoperative infection. As a
							result, doctors are reluctant to repeat them, such as when monitoring
							treatment response. In contrast, liquid biopsies are easily obtained
							with a routine blood draw, which are less risky and cost far less.
							They can be easily repeated as needed for monitoring progression,
							drug response, and relapse [4].
							</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify;">
						  Another benefit of liquid biopsies is that they provide a more comprehensive
							view of the disease. It is important to understand that tumours can be
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumour_heterogeneity"
							style="color:#1E90FF"> heterogeneous</a>
							– in other words, different regions of the tumour might
							exhibit different characteristics because of their respective genetic
							mutations and local environment, to name a few contributing factors.
							<b>Tumour heterogeneity</b> remains an important challenge in treating cancers
							since the whole tumour might not respond to a given treatment uniformly
							well [5]. Heterogeneity poses an issue for tissue biopsies, since typically
							only a small portion of the tumour is sampled. Consequently, a tissue
							biopsy might fail to reflect heterogeneity within the tumour [4]. This was
							initially the case with my father’s prostate cancer. When he was diagnosed,
							they could not explain the rapid PSA increase compared to the low
							<a href="https://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/prostate/grading/?region=on"
							style="color:#1E90FF"> Gleason score</a>
							of his prostate biopsies. A subsequent MRI revealed some cancer
							cells lying outside the normal sampling areas. As a result, another
							biopsy was conducted in this area, revealing a much more aggressive
							and fast-growing cancer. With liquid biopsies, most cells from the
							tumour contribute to the cfDNA pool, so a liquid biopsy should reflect
							the full diversity of the cancer [4].
							</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify;">
						  Building on this concept, liquid biopsies may encompass ctDNA from
							metastatic sites as well, typically well before the metastases are
							apparent through imaging. Liquid biopsies provide insight into <i>spatial
							and temporal</i> tumour heterogeneity at multiple sites throughout the
							body [2,4]. My father had his prostate removed, leaving behind nothing
							to biopsy; however, a liquid biopsy can monitor whether the cancer
							had metastasized prior to the prostatectomy (hopefully not). This
							particularly emphasizes why liquid biopsies are a valuable tool,
							even in cancers where it’s easy to take a tissue biopsy
							(like breast cancer).
							</p>

							<strong>Figure 2.</strong> Liquid biopsies carry many advantages

							<p style="text-align:justify;">
							It may sound like liquid biopsies are pure gold, but there are caveats.
							One main challenge is detection sensitivity when there’s low amounts
							of ctDNA in the blood [2,4]. The amount of ctDNA varies depending on
							tumor size, vascularity, other anatomical features, and the patient’s
							history of treatments (if they’ve had any) [4]. So depending on the
							clinical setting, particularly in cancer screening or relapse detection,
							there may be low amounts of ctDNA. Fortunately, continual development
							of various
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction#:~:text=Polymerase%20chain%20reaction%20(PCR)%20is,amount%20to%20study%20in%20detail."
							style="color:#1E90FF"> PCR</a>
							and

							style="color:#1E90FF"> next-generation sequencing</a>
							techniques are improving
							the sensitivity of ctDNA detection [2,4].
							</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify;">
						  All in all, tumour tissue biopsies won’t be disappearing anytime soon,
							but liquid biopsies are an exciting area for growth. There are many
							clinical settings where they could be applicable, such as cancer screening,
							therapy selection, monitoring treatment response, or monitoring recurrence [2,4].
							Commercial companies see this value, and tons of money have been invested
							into developing technologies for ctDNA testing, some of which are in the
							clinic already. I hope you can see the value as well, and that you enjoyed
							reading this simple introduction to liquid biopsies and ctDNA. If you
							still have reservations about liquid biopsies, just think – which would
							you prefer: a blood test or getting a hunk of tissue taken out of you?
